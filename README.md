# Problem Statement:
Intoxicated driving accidents impact everyone involved, from victims themselves to the onlookers that witness the accident.
That is why we want to make make everyone aware of what exactly happens when you are in a traffic accident. Maybe, after going through a simulated traffic accident, people will realise the seriousness of the situation they might cause by drunk or intoxicated driving.

People don’t realise what it is like to be in an actual (horrible) traffic accident.

# Our vision:

We want the general public to be aware about what the aftermath is of a fatal car accident.

After experiencing our game or ‘simulation’ we want people to realize the amount of damage that can occur when you get involved in a traffic accident. Everybody will realize the seriousness of the situation and drive responsibly.
